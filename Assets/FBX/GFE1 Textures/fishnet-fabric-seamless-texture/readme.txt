To use the substance painter materials you need to drag every sbsar file to the following location: c: > program files > allegorithmic > substance painter > resources > shelf > allegorithmic > materials (drag my folder travis davids 24 substance painter materials into the materials folder. Restart substance painter and they should show in the materials section of sp. They take some time to load so please be patient)

If the materials still don't load, drag one of the materials into the sp workspace, change undefined to base material and at the the bottom where it says "import your resources to" select shelf. This is also an alternative method for importing the materials into sp. 

Please ensure you change resolution to 4k in substance painter to view its true resolution and also view the materials in iray to see them properly. 

Tip: use black masks and uv selection to apply materials onto different parts of a garment. This ensures materials don't overlap and blend ontop of each other unless this is the effect you want. 

The materials include a diffuse, roughness, metallic/specular, opacity and a normal map. For materials that don't have a metallic/specular map you sometimes need to play around with the specular value or use a darker grey color on your specular shader to decrease any unwanted glossiness. 

Sometimes decreasing the intensity of the normal map can give you varied results as well.

Materials were scanned and then further enhanced using substance designer or created completely from scratch using substance designer.  

I still wouldn't recommend these for extreme closeups. They are fine for close to mid range. 

These are meant for clothing but they could also be used for environmental props like blankets, curtains, carpets etc.

The following video was for the release of part 1 of the fabric pack but covers all of the techniques to setup and use my materials.
